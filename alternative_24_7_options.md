# Alternative Free 24/7 Hosting Options for Your Minecraft Bot

Since we're having issues with the Replit URL, here are several alternative approaches to keep your bot running 24/7 for free:

## Option 1: Replit's Always On Feature

Replit offers an "Always On" feature that keeps your repl running continuously. Here's how to enable it:

1. Go to your project page on Replit
2. Click on the "Tools" menu in the left sidebar
3. Select "Always On"
4. Toggle it to "On"

This feature is available with Replit's paid plans, but sometimes Replit offers free credits or trials.

## Option 2: Use a Different Uptime Service

Try these alternative uptime monitoring services:

1. **FreshPing**
   - Go to [FreshPing](https://www.freshworks.com/website-monitoring/)
   - Create a free account
   - Add a new monitor with your Replit URL
   - Set the check interval to 1 minute

2. **Uptime-Kuma (Self-hosted option)**
   - If you have access to another always-on computer, you can set up [Uptime-Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma)
   - Configure it to ping your Replit URL regularly

## Option 3: Use a Webhook Service

1. **IFTTT**
   - Create an account on [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)
   - Create an applet that pings your Replit URL every few minutes
   - This can be done by setting up a time-based trigger and a webhook action

2. **Zapier**
   - Similar to IFTTT, Zapier can be configured to ping your URL on a schedule

## Option 4: GitHub Actions

If you have a GitHub account, you can use GitHub Actions to create a workflow that pings your Replit URL:

1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Add a .github/workflows/ping.yml file with content like:

```yaml
name: Ping Replit

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'  # Run every 5 minutes

jobs:
  ping:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Ping Replit
        run: curl https://your-replit-url.repl.co
```

## Option 5: PM2 (Process Manager)

Your bot already has PM2 installed, which helps keep it running within Replit. The PM2 configuration in ecosystem.config.js should ensure the bot restarts if it crashes.

## Option 6: Rent a VPS

If none of the above options work, consider moving your bot to a Virtual Private Server (VPS):

- **Oracle Cloud Free Tier**: Offers always-free VM instances
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Has a free tier with $300 credit for 90 days
- **Amazon Web Services**: Has a free tier for 12 months

## Best Practices

Regardless of which method you choose:

1. Make sure your bot has proper error handling and automatic reconnection
2. Implement anti-AFK measures (which we've already done)
3. Configure your Aternos server settings to keep the bot connected
4. Monitor the bot regularly to ensure it's still working

Remember that free Aternos servers shut down when no players are online, so your bot may disconnect until the server is started again.
